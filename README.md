# FullStack Spring Boot Application
A full-stack Spring Boot application with separate backend and frontend modules. The backend is built using Spring Boot (SpringServer), while the frontend (springClinte1) handles client-side interaction. The project includes REST APIs, user interaction, and structured modular code for learning and deployment purposes.



This repository contains a full-stack Java project with a Spring Boot backend and a Java-based frontend (client). The backend exposes REST APIs, and the frontend consumes them for user interaction.
